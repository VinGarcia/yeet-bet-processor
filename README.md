WIP, slice 1.

## Health check

`GET /health` is an **unauthenticated** endpoint. It is a load-balancer /
Kubernetes liveness + readiness probe, not a user-facing route. It returns:

- `200 { "status": "ok", "db": "ok" }` when the database is reachable.
- `503 { "status": "ok", "db": "down" }` when the service is up but its database
  dependency is not.

The HMAC auth added in a later slice applies to the business endpoints only; the
probe is intentionally left open so infrastructure can check service health.
